Hello, my name is Bryce! 👋🏿 I started learning iOS Development my freshman year of college as a Computer Science major.📍 I've been on the iNGAGED team since May 2023.

- What I like about Native Development is Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and what it means to design a great experience for any Apple platform

- Initially, design seemed like a daunting skill to learn in iOS Development, but it has become an art that I truly appreciate. When building my own app, I had to design an app icon and all the UI elements. Additionally, I recognized the importance of prototyping. Being able to visualize what an app should look like or interact with a new feature before investing development time has become a strategy I employ, inspired this [WWDC session](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014/223/).

  
### Agile:

- The [Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/) serves as the ultimate guideline to follow. For me, Agile is about effectively managing a software project. It involves a team that is committed to a shared mission, works collaboratively, communicates honestly and constructively, and ultimately builds software that solves real-world problems.
