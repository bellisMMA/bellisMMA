Hello, my name is Bryce! 👋🏿 I am an iOS developer located in Memphis, TN. I started learning iOS development in 2017 as a freshman in college. I built a couple micro-projects using Swift, UIKit, and ARKit throughout my computer science degree to help supplement my university learnings. After graduation I committed myself to iOS dev by building and launching an Apple Watch app using SwiftUI and HealthKit. Along the process I've gained a strong intrest in iOS development, design skills using Sketch, and following Agile methodoliges.
