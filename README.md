Hello, my name is Bryce! 👋🏿 I have a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Memphis, and I am an iOS developer located in Memphis, TN. 📍 I've been on the iNGAGED team since May 2023, and I am so happy to grow my professional experience here. Talk to me about all things iOS development, Design, or Agile methodoliges!

### Technical Skills:

- I used Xcode for the first time in July 2017. I used Udemy to learn mobile app development using Swift and UIKit. For the next couple of years I built micro-projects from tutorials that helped me to explore iOS SDK Frameworks such as MapKit, ARKit, Pods, and CoreData. After graduating and running the 50-mile race, I had an idea to build an Apple Watch app from scratch, which accelerated my knownledge in native iOS development. I got to learn designing apps following Apple's Design Guidelines and integrating with brand new Apple SDK's like SwiftUI and HealthKit. In addition to learning the technical skills of building a watchOS app, I learned all the intricacies of submitting to the App Store and maintaining it. 

### Design:

- When I first started learning iOS Development design was a daunting skill, but it's an art that has definetly grown on me. Building my own app I had to design an app icon and all the UI elements, and even further the importance of Prototyping. Being able to design what an app should look like or interacting with a new feature before spending development time is a stradegy I apply from a [WWDC rewind](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014/223/)

  
### Agile:

- The ultimate guideline to follow is the [Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/). To me Agile is about how to manage a software project, it's about a team that is committed to a shared mission, works well together, is honest and constructive in their communication, and at the end of the day builds software that solves a real-world problem.
