Hello, my name is Bryce! 👋🏿 I have a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Memphis, and I am an iOS developer located in Memphis, TN. 📍 I've been on the iNGAGED team since May 2023, and I am thrilled to be gaining valuable professional experience here. Feel free to discuss anything related to iOS development, design, or Agile methodologies with me!

- I first started using Xcode in July 2017. To learn mobile app development using Swift and UIKit, I utilized Udemy. Over the next few years, I worked on various micro-projects from tutorials, which allowed me to explore iOS SDK Frameworks such as MapKit, ARKit, Pods, and CoreData. After graduating and completing a 50-mile race, I embarked on building an Apple Watch app from scratch. This experience greatly enhanced my knowledge of native iOS development. I also learned how to design apps following Apple's Design Guidelines and integrate with new Apple SDKs like SwiftUI and HealthKit. Alongside the technical aspects of building a watchOS app, I gained insights into the intricacies of submitting to the App Store and maintaining it.

### Design:

- Initially, design seemed like a daunting skill to learn in iOS Development, but it has become an art that I truly appreciate. When building my own app, I had to design an app icon and all the UI elements. Additionally, I recognized the importance of prototyping. Being able to visualize what an app should look like or interact with a new feature before investing development time has become a strategy I employ, inspired this [WWDC session](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2014/223/).

  
### Agile:

- The [Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/) serves as the ultimate guideline to follow. For me, Agile is about effectively managing a software project. It involves a team that is committed to a shared mission, works collaboratively, communicates honestly and constructively, and ultimately builds software that solves real-world problems.
